		When I was younger, I was really (and I mean really) into Legos. I probably accumulated over a dozen sets during my childhood and could have had a dozen more if they weren’t so darn expensive. There’s something magical about taking a set of individual pieces and combining them to make something special. Of course, as time went on I started to grow away from the colorful blocks, but I still had a desire of build. That’s where my passion for cooking came in. Instead of taking 50 blocks and building a house, I was able to take a handful of ingredients and spices and turn them into a delicious meal.

		If it’s not clear by now, I love cooking. I’m a reformed picky eater who has finally seen the light. I missed out on most foods that weren’t tacos, pizza, and chicken nuggets for years, so I’m making up for it by being adventurous with what I eat and how I prepare it. I love spice, so you’ll see that as a theme in my favorite recipes, but spice is a double-edged sword. I’m a tech guy from a big city, so I spent a lot of time eating processed foods that lacked any nutritional value or was so overloaded with salt and sugar, you could hardly distinguish any other flavors. Because of that, I like to focus on working with natural foods when I can. Fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, herbs, and spices are key to building a memorable meal.
